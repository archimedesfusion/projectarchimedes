			Archimedes
		</h1>
		Archimedes is a famous greek inventor and engineer. He was decades ahead of his time
		with some of his engineering concepts, and he was the first person to discover the 
		geometrical constant known as "pi".  Our logo is a tribute to his work and creation of 
		some of the founding principles of geometry.
